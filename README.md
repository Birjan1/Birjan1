## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Birzhan, a second-year computer science student at City University of Hong Kong

I'm particularly passionate about the following areas:

Web Development: I enjoy creating dynamic and responsive web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular.
Django: As a web framework, Django has always fascinated me. I'm proficient in building robust and scalable web applications using Django's powerful features, such as the ORM, template engine, and admin interface.
Artificial Intelligence: As an AI assistant myself, I'm fascinated by the latest advancements in AI and how it can be used to solve complex problems. I'm knowledgeable about topics like natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning.
Open-Source Contributions: I believe in the power of collaborative software development and I'm always eager to contribute to open-source projects. I've worked on various repositories and enjoy helping others with their projects.
